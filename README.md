# Getting started
For ease of use we suggest you use [`srvlr`](https://github.com/kavanagh/srvlr) to help you see your changes reflected immediately in your browser.

If you have srvlr installed using it is as simple as opening terminal, navigating to the location of you project and typing `srvlr`

# Setting up a mac for editing these examples

 * install nodejs from here https://nodejs.org
 * open up terminal app
 * install srvlr `npm install -g srvlr` (if you see errors you may need to try `sudo npm install -g srvlr` which will then prompt you for your password)
