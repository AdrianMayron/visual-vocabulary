chartName,category,img,avail,descriptionbar-diverging,Deviation,bar-diverging.svg,TRUE,A simple standard bar chart that can handle both negative and positive magnitude valuesbar-diverging-stacked,Deviation,bar-diverging-stacked.svg,TRUE,"Perfect for presenting survey results which involve sentiment (eg disagree, neutral, agreed"spine-chart,Deviation,spine.svg,FALSE,Splits a single value into 2 contrasting components (eg Male/Female)line-surplus-deficit-filled,Deviation,line-surplur-defecit-fill.svg,FALSE,The shaded area of these charts allows a balance to be shown;  either against a baseline or between two seriescatterplot,Correlation,scatterplot.svg,TRUE,"The standard way to show the relationship between two variables, each of which has its own axis"line-column,Correlation,line-column.svg,TRUE,A good way of showing the relationship between an amount (columns) and a rate (line)scatterplot-connected,Correlation,scatterplot-connected.svg,TRUE,Usually used to show how the relationship between 2 variables has changed over timeBubble,Correlation,bubble.svg,TRUE,"Like a scatterplot, but adds additional detail by sizing the circles according to a third variable"XY-heatmap,Correlation,XY-heatmap.svg,TRUE,"A good way of showing the patterns between 2 categories of data, less good at showing fine differences in amounts"line,Change v Time,line.svg,TRUE,"The standard way to show a changing time series. If data are irregular, consider markers to represent data points"column-timeline,Change v Time,column-timeline.svg,TRUE,Columns work well for showing change over time - but usually best with only one series of data at a timecolumn-line-timeline,Change v Time,column-line-timeline.svg,TRUE,A good way of showing the relationship over time between an amount (columns) and a rate (line)stock-price,Change v Time,stock-price.svg,FALSE,"Usually focused on day-to-day activity, these charts show opening/closing and hi/low points of each day"slope,Change v Time,slope-timeline.svg,TRUE,Good for showing changing data as long as the data can be simplified into 2 or 3 points without missing a key part of storyarea,Change v Time,area.svg,TRUE,"Use with care. These are good at showing changes to total, but seeing change in components can be very difficult."fan,Change v Time,fan.svg,FALSE,Use to show the uncertainty in future projections - usually this grows the further forward to projectionscatterplot-line-timeline,Change v Time,scatterplot-line-timeline.svg,FALSE,A good way of showing changing data for two variables whenever there is a relatively clear pattern of progression. Connected scatterplotcalendar-heatmap,Change v Time,calendar-heatmap.svg,TRUE,"A great way of showing temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly), at the expense of showing precision in quantity"priestley timeline,Change v Time,priestley-timeline.svg,TRUE,Great when date and duration are key elements of the story in the datacircles-timeline,Change v Time,circle-timeline.svg,TRUE,Good for showing discrete values of varying size across multiple categories (eg earthquakes by contintent)seismogram,Change v Time,seismogram.svg,FALSE,Another alternative to the circle timeline for showing series where there are big variations in the databar-ordered,Ranking,bar-ordered.svg,TRUE,Standard bar charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into ordercolumn-ordered,Ranking,column-ordered.svg,TRUE,Standard column charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into ordersymbol-proportional-ordered,Ranking,symbol-proportional-ordered.svg,FALSE,Use when there are big variations between values and/or seeingfinne differences between data is not so important.dot-plot-strip,Ranking,dot-plot-strip.svg,FALSE,Dots placed in order on a strip are a space-efficient method of laying out ranks across multiple categories.slope,Ranking,slope-ranking.svg,TRUE,Perfect for showing how ranks have changed over time or vary between categories. lollipop-h,Ranking,lollipop-h.svg,TRUE,Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectivelylollipop-v,Ranking,lollipop-v.svg,TRUE,Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectively
