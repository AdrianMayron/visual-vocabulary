If data are irregular, consider markers to represent data points"column-timeline,Change v Time,column-timeline.svg,TRUE,Columns work well for showing change over time - but usually best with only one series of data at a timecolumn-line-timeline,Change v Time,column-line-timeline.svg,TRUE,A good way of showing the relationship over time between an amount (columns) and a rate (line)stock-price,Change v Time,stock-price.svg,FALSE,"Usually focused on day-to-day activity, these charts show opening/closing and hi/low points of each day"slope,Change v Time,slope-timeline.svg,TRUE,Good for showing changing data as long as the data can be simplified into 2 or 3 points without missing a key part of storyarea,Change v Time,area.svg,TRUE,"Use with care. These are good at showing changes to total, but seeing change in components can be very difficult."fan,Change v Time,fan.svg,FALSE,Use to show the uncertainty in future projections - usually this grows the further forward to projectionscatterplot-line-timeline,Change v Time,scatterplot-line-timeline.svg,FALSE,A good way of showing changing data for two variables whenever there is a relatively clear pattern of progression. Connected scatterplotcalendar-heatmap,Change v Time,calendar-heatmap.svg,TRUE,"A great way of showing temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly), at the expense of showing precision in quantity"priestley timeline,Change v Time,priestley-timeline.svg,TRUE,Great when date and duration are key elements of the story in the datacircles-timeline,Change v Time,circle-timeline.svg,TRUE,Good for showing discrete values of varying size across multiple categories (eg earthquakes by contintent)seismogram,Change v Time,seismogram.svg,FALSE,Another alternative to the circle timeline for showing series where there are big variations in the databar-ordered,Ranking,bar-ordered.svg,TRUE,Standard bar charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into ordercolumn-ordered,Ranking,column-ordered.svg,TRUE,Standard column charts display the ranks of values much more easily when sorted into ordersymbol-proportional-ordered,Ranking,symbol-proportional-ordered.svg,FALSE,Use when there are big variations between values and/or seeingfinne differences between data is not so important.dot-plot-strip,Ranking,dot-plot-strip.svg,FALSE,Dots placed in order on a strip are a space-efficient method of laying out ranks across multiple categories.slope,Ranking,slope-ranking.svg,TRUE,Perfect for showing how ranks have changed over time or vary between categories. lollipop-h,Ranking,lollipop-h.svg,TRUE,Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectivelylollipop-v,Ranking,lollipop-v.svg,TRUE,Lollipop charts draw more attention to the data value than standard bar/column and can also show rank effectivelyhistogram,Distribution,histogram.svg,TRUE,The standard way to show a statistical distribution - keep the gaps between columns small to highlight the 'shape' of the data.boxplot,Distribution,boxplot.svg,TRUE,Summarise multiple distributions by showing the median (centre) and range of the dataviolin,Distribution,violin.svg,FALSE,Similar to a box plot but more effective with complex distributions (data that cannot be summarised with simple average).population-pyramis,Distribution,population-pyramis.svg,FALSE,"A standard way for showing the age and sex breakdown of a population distribution; effectively, back to back histograms"dot-plot-strip,Distribution,dot-plot-strip-distribution.svg,FALSE,"Good for showing individual values in a distribution, can be a problem when too many dots have the same value"dot-plot,Distribution,dot-plot.svg,TRUE,A simple way of showing the range (min/max) of data across multiple categories.barcode,Distribution,barcode.svg,FALSE,"Like dot strip plots, good for displaying all the data in a table,they work best when highlighting individual values."cumulative-curve,Distribution,cumulative-curve.svg,FALSE,"A good way of showing how unequal a distribution is: y axis is always cumulative frequency, x axis is always a measure."column-stacked,Part to whole,column-stacked.svg,TRUE,A simple way of showing part-to-whole relationships but can be difficult to read with more than a few components.bar-stacked-proportional,Part to whole,bar-stacked-proportional.svg,TRUE,"A good way of showing the size and proportion of data at the same time, as long as the data are not too complicated. "pie,Part to whole,pie.svg,TRUE,A common way of showing part-to-whole data - but be aware that it's difficult to accurately compare the size of the segments.doughnut,Part to whole,doughnut.svg,TRUE,Similar to a pie chart - but the centre can be a good way of making space to include more information about the data (eg. total)treemap,Part to whole,treemap.svg,TRUE,Use for hierarchical part-to-whole relationships; can be difficult to read when there are many small segments.Voronoi,Part to whole,voronoi.svg,FALSE,A way of turning points into areas - any point within the area is closer to the central point than any other pointsunburst,Part to whole,sunburst.svg,FALSE,Another way of visualisaing hierarchical part-to-whole relationships. Use sparingly (if at all) for obvious reasons.arc,Part to whole,arc.svg,FALSE,"A hemicycle, often used for visualising political results."gridplot,Part to whole,gridplot.svg,FALSE,"Good for showing % information, they work best when used on whole numbers and work well in multiple layout form. "Venn,Part to whole,venn.svg,FALSE,Generally only used for schematic representationWaterfall,Part to whole,waterfall.svg,TRUE,Can be useful for showing part-to-whole relationships where some of the components are negative.
